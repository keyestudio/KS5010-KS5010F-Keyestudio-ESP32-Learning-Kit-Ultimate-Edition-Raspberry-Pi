# Project 19：Servo Sweep

1.  Introduction：

Servo is an electric motor that can rotate very precisely. At present,
it has been widely used in toy cars，remote control
helicopters，airplanes，robots, etc. In this project, we will use
ESP32 to control the rotation of the servo.

Servo：

![](/media/99830768916233a9c5900ac399006c17.png)

The servo is a kind of position servo driver, which is mainly composed
of housing、circuit board、copless motor、gear and position detector. Its
working principle is that the receiver or microcontroller sends a signal
to the servo which has an internal reference circuit that generates a
reference signal with a period of 20ms and a width of 1.5ms, and
compares the DC bias voltage with the voltage of the potentiometer to
output voltage difference.The IC on the circuit board determines the
direction of rotation, and then drives the coreless motor to start
rotation and transmits the power to the swing arm through the reduction
gear, while the position detector sends back a signal to determine
whether it has reached the positioning. It is suitable for those control
systems that require constant change of angle and can be maintained.
When the motor rotates at a certain speed, the potentiometer is driven
by the cascade reduction gear to rotate so that the voltage difference
is 0 and the motor stops rotating. The angle range of general servo
rotation is 0 to 180 degrees.

The pulse period for controlling the servo is 20ms, the pulse width is
0.5ms to 2.5ms, and the corresponding position is -90 degrees to +90
degrees. The following is an example of a 180 degree servo：

Servo motors have many specifications, but they all have three
connecting wires, which are brown, red, and orange (different brands may
have different colors). The brown is GND, the red is the positive power
supply, and the orange is the signal line.

4.  Wiring Diagram：
    
    When supplying the servo, please note that the power supply voltage
    should be 3.3V-5V. Make sure there are no errors when connecting the
    servo to the power supply.

5.  Adding the ESP32Servo library：

This code uses a library named "**ESP32Servo**", If you haven't
installed it yet, please do so before learning. The steps to add
third-party libraries are as follows:

6.  Project code：

After the **ESP32Servo** library is added, you can open the code we
provide：

The code used in this project is saved in folder **“3. Raspberry Pi
System\\C\_Tutorial\\2.Projects\\Project 19：Servo
Sweep\\Project\_19\_Servo\_Sweep”.**

    }
    void loop() {
    
      for (posVal = 0; posVal <= 180; posVal += 1) { // goes from 0 degrees to 180 degrees
        // in steps of 1 degree
        myservo.write(posVal);       // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
        delay(15);                   // waits 15ms for the servo to reach the position
      }
      for (posVal = 180; posVal >= 0; posVal -= 1) { // goes from 180 degrees to 0 degrees
        myservo.write(posVal);       // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
        delay(15);                   // waits 15ms for the servo to reach the position
      }
    }
    //********************************************************************************


6. Project result：

Compile and upload the code to ESP32, after the code is uploaded
successfully, power up with a USB cable and you will see that the Servo
will rotate from 0 degrees to 180 degrees and then reverse the direction
to make it rotate from 180 degrees to 0 degrees and repeat these actions
in an endless loop.
